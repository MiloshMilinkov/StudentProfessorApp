This application was made as a parallel project with learning MVC from the great YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/kudvenkat
The developed app will have the following features:
-User login and signup
-Viewing/editing roles as well as assigning roles(student, professor)
-If the user is assigned as a student, he will be given the option to do exams and view results.
-If the user is assigned as a professor, he will be given the option to make/edit and delete exams.
The app is developed fully in MVC.
